# Unode? I node!

`unode` is enhanced node.js written in JavaScript.

Unode is a drop-in replacement for node.js, just run your apps with `unode`, instead of `node`:

    unode app.js
    
Installation:

    npm install -g unode

Future goals of `unode`:

- 1. **More APIs:** `unode` will provide richer set of standard library APIs.  
- 2. **No dependencies:** gradually `unode` project will remove all native
 dependencies of `Node.js`, including `Node.js`, `libuv` and even `V8` itself.
 You will be able to pick any JS interpreter, including [`js.js`](https://github.com/jterrace/js.js/)
 if you wish so.
